To make it easier for the neural network to process, we divide each value by 255 to get to a number between 0 and 1 for each pixel in each image.

The rows are the correct value and the columns are the predicted value. The numbers on the axes represent the 26 letters in the alphabet (though EMNIST just represents letters as numbers, so 0=A, 1=B, etc.), so the brightness of cell (0,0) represents the number of times that our network correctly predicted that an \"A\" is an \"A.\"  The diagonal line of cells shows when the predicted value is correct.
